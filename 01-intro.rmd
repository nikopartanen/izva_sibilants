# Introduction

<!-- <center><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="abstract.pdf"></iframe></center> -->

I start this study with citation from one of the conversations which initially pointed me that this phenomena exists and there is some potential for further research. One of my Komi teachers in Syktyvkar, folklorist Valentina Viktorovna, once recalled after days lectures how she had encountered different patterns of pronunciation, in this case in Siberia.

select_by_time <- function(eaf_table, time_start = 547981, time_end = 578751){
#        selection_start = lubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms(time_start)) * 1000
#        selection_end = lubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms(time_end)) * 1000
        eaf_table %>% distinct(Orth, Speaker, TS1_time, TS2_time)  %>% filter(Speaker == "VVF-F-1957") %>%
                filter(TS1_time > time_start) %>% filter(TS1_time < time_end)
}

## Transcription system

Uralic Phonetic Alphabet (henceforth UPA) is commonly used transcription system in Uralistics. It is very exact and in all real applications interchangeable with IPA. The main issue I see with UPA is that it is used in widely different manner by different researchers in the descriptions of different languages. This creates rather good uniformity within language varieties, i.e. transcribed Komi follows more or less the same conventions, as does transcribed Meadow Mari or Tundra Nenets, but these transcriptions are not easily comparable. And although being very exact in many nuances, it is well known that UPA does not distinguish **palatal place of articulation** from **palatalized manner of articulation**. Thereby following grapheme when used in transcription:

> ś

Could represent either phones

> sʲ or ɕ

There are very few languages in which these variants would be phonemically distinct. Naturally one can always come up with ad-hoc conventions to mark these differences, but this again feeds to the problem I described above: lack of comparability between transcripts.

### Transcription system used in this study {#transcription-system}

The transcription system used in Iźva Komi Documentation Project is in Cyrillic and it follows closely the conventions of Komi orthography. It is the same transcription system used in new Komi dialect dictionaries published recently [@beznosikovaEtAl2012a]. It doesn't mark allophonic variatian, but captures Komi phoneme inventory in a very satisfactory manner. As every pohonene is represented, it is possible to convert this transcription into other transcription systems, such as IPA or UPA. In this study I have used IPA as described in the International Phonetic Association's handbook [@ipa1999a].

The Cyrillic transcription used in IKDP is essentially phonemic, but due to conventions of Cyrillic orthography there is no one-to-one correspondence between the characters used. Instead, there are complex one-to-many correspondences, which nevertheless are systematic and resolving between these should, in principle, be possible in all cases. There are some corner cases and murky areas in Komi phonology, but in the larger picture those do not problematize the situation too much. There are several good reasons to select Cyrillic based orthography in the first place:

- Orthography represents already Komi phoneme inventory very well
- There is already good amount of language technology around Komi Zyrian written language, using Cyrillic transcription makes that compatible
- Native speakers have more immediate access to the data
- Cyrillic transcription is relatively ignorant about the realizations of underlying allophones, so one can conveniently remain at the phoneme level without putting spoon into too many soups

## Phenomena

Russian and Komi have relatively similar phonological distinction between plain velars and their "soft" variants. Orthographically they are marked similarly in both languages, using same conventions of Cyrillic orhography. The actual realizations of the phones, the allophones, within these phonemes are often rather distinct, Russian phoneme usually being rather prototypical alveolar palatalized sibilant /sʲ/. In Komi the phoneme in question is relatively different /ɕ/.  Russian also contains phone [ɕ:], phonemic status of which seems to be debated [@chew2003a, 64], marked with Cyrillic grapheme \<щ\>. This phone seems to be very close to the phoneme /ɕ/ found in Komi.

<!-- prostoj : proɕ:e 
     osʲenʲ : osʲenʲu-
     счастье > [ˈɕːæsʲtʲjə] 
     -->

The linguistic variable my investigation focuses into is this relatively simple alterations in the sibilant articulation. It is possible to analyze it as variation between two variants, although acoustically the phenomena is little bit more complicated as some pronunciations are kind of in-between. However, in the majority of cases it is relatively straightforward to assign one value or another.

## Research questions

* Is the variation connected to language contact
* If so, is Russian the source language
* How this variation can be described
* What is the areal scope of this variation
* What is the temporal scope of this variation
* Is the variant sociolinguistically significant

If some of these questions cannot be answered, the reasons to this would also be worth its own investigation.

## Data

All my data comes from Iźva Komi Documentation Project which has been funded by Kone Foundation in 2014-2016 and led by Rogier Blokland, Michael Rießler and Marina Fedina. For the first two years of the project I worked in it as a full time PhD student, and my tasks were closely connected to curating, extending and annotating the Komi corpus in question. The project has collected large amount of new data from the areas where Iźva Komi is spoken, but at the same time it is closely connected to older data sources. Naturally, there is no thinking that we would be the first researchers collecting data from these speech varieties -- already M.A. Castrén wrote his grammar based to this variery [@castren1844a].

Although the majority of our effort has gone to working with our own data, we have also incorporated to the corpus data from variety of older sources. We have prioritized the data for which audio recordings exist, but even the materials with no audio can be extremely valuable. Naturally with mere transcriptions there arises the issue of verification -- it is not possible to examine more closely what lies behind the transcribed segments. On the other hand, I think we must start our work with the expectation that the scholars who have worked before us must have had similarly high standards as we do. In some sense also quantity can be used to verify the quality, as the transcriptions which show systematic patterns in larger amounts of text are very likely valid. More so if these patterns are somehow connected to what can be observed in the current and contemporary recordings.

The availability of earlier materials makes contemporary language corpora very heterogenic. Or better to say, they have the potential to do this. Many corpora are still created on basis of individual recording sessions in a fairly traditional settings, but as the world is full of online resources and printed materials, one is often tempted to include these into corpus whenever possible. This makes corpus curation more complicated task, and it demands that the corpus user has some access and understanding of the overall structure of the corpus. In real world applications the data selected for research use would often be a sample from the complete corpus. This sounds in many ways like a normal scientific procedure, so I think one can assume that's a good way to go.

In my case the most important subcorpora have been the Nenets Autonomous Okrug section of Iźva Komi Documentation Project, transcriptions provided in Syrjänische Texte II by T.E. Uotila, the recordings of Eric Vászolyi from Kanin Peninsula and Kolva region, and the TV broadcasts of Radio Yamala in early winter of 2016.

### Open issues with data

* Lack of data from Russian dialects
* What are the limitations of language documentation corpora
* Can TV broadcast data be used to phonetic analysis?
* How to differentiate Russian loanwords from already native elements (for example, very old opaque loanwords)
