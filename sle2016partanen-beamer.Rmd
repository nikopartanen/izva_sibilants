## Introduction

- My PhD studies are about variation in Komi dialects
- Last three years I've been involved with compilation of different Komi corpora (Udora + Iźva)
- Lots of research done on Komi dialectology, but access to digital + georeferenced data gives new possibilities
- I work currently in INEL project in Hamburg University
- I use in this study Iźva Komi corpus which will be archived in the end of 2016

## Komi language -- Iźva dialect

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, comment=F}

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikopartanen/language_maps/master/geojson/kom.geojson"
res <- readOGR(dsn = url, layer = "OGRGeoJSON", verbose = F)

basemap <- leaflet() %>% setView(lng = 54.583, lat = 63.833, zoom = 4) %>% 
        addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
        addPolygons(data = res, weight = 1, color = "#0000ff", fill = "#0000ff") %>% 
        addPolygons(data = res[grepl("izva", res@data$dial), ], weight = 1, color = "red", fill = "red")

basemap
```

## Epicenter of expansion -- Ižma village

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, comment=F}
icons <- iconList(home = makeIcon(iconUrl = "https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG/raw/master/black/png/128/home.png", 
                                  iconWidth = 24, iconHeight = 24),
                  lang_contact = makeIcon(iconUrl = "https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG/raw/master/black/png/128/commenting-o.png", 
                                          iconWidth = 24, iconHeight = 24))
homemap <- basemap %>% addMarkers(data = data_frame(lat = 65.009167, long = 53.916944), icon = icons$home)
homemap
```

## Just a note -- Iźva is an offshoot of Upper-Vym dialect

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, comment=F}
homemap %>% addPolygons(data = res[ which(res@data$dial == "vym"), ], weight = 3, color = "black", fill = NA) 
```

## And this area was not Komi speaking before

```{r}
basemap %>% 
        addPolygons(data = res[ which(res@data$dial == "izva" & res@data$desc != "izhma"), ], weight = 3, color = "black", fill = NA) # %>%
#        addCircles(data = data_frame(lon = 50.99872, lat = 60.3454), radius = 65000)
```


### Background

- Ižma itself populated from Upper Vym at the 16th century
- Expansion since 19th century
- Connected to the reindeer husbandry
- Strong Russian and Nenets admixture
- Local contacts with Saami, Khanty and Mansi

### Iźva Within Komi

- Shares developments with rest of Northern Komi Zyrian dialects
- Especially the relation Upper Vym is very transparent
- Mutually intelligible with all Komi varieties
- Culturally and ethnically distinct Komi subgroup

## My data

- Iźva Komi Documentation Project -- funded by Kone Foundation in 2014-2016.
- Four fieldwork periods by now
- Cooperation with local researchers
- Semi-structured interviews, not much elicitation
- Majority of the recordings in Komi, but also some in Russian
- Attempts rough balance (roughly in following order)
    - geographical regions
    - age groups
    - sex
    - different genres and registers present
- **I don't claim that the corpus is balanced!**

## What about the sibilants?

```{r, echo=F}

FRelan::read_tier("/Volumes/langdoc/langs/kpv/kpv_izva20111014VVF-1/kpv_izva20111014VVF-1.eaf", "phonet-ipaT", "VVF-F-1957") %>% 
        select(content, ref_id) %>%
        rename(ipa = content) %>% select(-ref_id) -> ipa

FRelan::read_tier("/Volumes/langdoc/langs/kpv/kpv_izva20111014VVF-1/kpv_izva20111014VVF-1.eaf", "ft-engT", "VVF-F-1957") %>% 
        select(content, ref_id) %>%
        rename(ft_eng = content) %>% select(-ref_id) -> ft_eng


cbind(ipa, ft_eng) %>% select(ipa, ft_eng) %>% knitr::kable()
```

[@kpv_izva20111014VVF-1]

- Many descriptions of Komi phonology leave it quite open what kind of sibilants Komi actually has
- It is common to use some conventions to distinguish palatalized sʲ in Russian and its palatal or palato-alveolar counterpart in Komi
- For example, ś ~ š', s' ~ s''
- I personally would had transcribed these as sʲ and ɕ
    + Would lead into marking Komi palatal affricates as cɕ and ɟʑ
- In Uralic Phonetic Alphabet this is all simple as one marks just: t'ś and d'ź
    + Although this just has the same ambivalency in regard to Russian counterparts
    + Minute differences would be marked by throwing arrows around them
- Of course one could pick any random characters to mark this distinction
    + But this leads to problems if one has both languages present
- This is actually what I do, since it isn't central for my argument what they are, mainly that they differ from Russian

- The following examples illustrate the differences in Komi and Russian sibilants

##

![Example: vaɕilej](data/praat_MSF_vasilei_kpv.png)

##

![Example: vasʲilej](data/praat_MSF_vasilei_rus.png)

## 

Now I know some people like to transcribe these Komi sibilants, which probably could be more accurately described palato-alveolar or prepalatal, as **ç** and **ʝ**. 

One argument for marking it with /ɕ/ would be that also Russian consonant phoneme /ɕ/, orthographically [щ], is regularly transcribed as /ɕ/. At least in the Russian of the Komi speakers these are regularly pronounced in very similar manner, and the bilingual speakers also tend to judge these as same sound.

## Palatalation as areal feature

- There are lots of features which vary inside Iźva speaking area
    - level of deaffricatization
    - **palato-alveolar sibilants pronounced as palatalized**
    - reanalyzation of morphology (gəgərvonɨ ~ vonɨ gəgər)
    - metathesis: ninem > nimen
    - palatalized environment related vowel changes: ɕöd > sʲed
    - Some sporadic (?) changes: medɕa > medja
- This variation tends to get really messy when one takes a closer look

- The phenomena I call here palatalization is the shift to more Russian-like pronunciation

## Example of the phenomena in action

`r gloss("no me rədiccɨ-l-i ɕolin sʲikt-ɨn.", "well I born-FREQ-1SG.PST Scholin village-INES", "Well, I was born in the Scholin (Щолин) village. [@kpv_izva20150406-3-a-002]")`

`r gloss("pasʲkɨd-dʑɨk-a paɕkɨd-dʑɨk-a pasʲkɨd-dʑɨk-a", "wide-COMP-ADV wide-COMP-ADV wide-COMP-ADV", "Should I tell about my life **broader? Broader. Broader**, alright. [@kpv_izva20150411-1-b-008]")`

## Several patterns

- ɕ > sʲ in all environments: /sʲələm/, not /ɕölöm /
- ɕ > sʲ before front vowels: /seɕɕa/ but /sʲir/
- ɕ everywhere, sʲ only in Russian words: /pensʲija/
- sʲ everywhere, ɕ only in Russian words: /vobɕe/

As all speakers are bilingual, the both systems necessarily coexist.

### Geographic distribution

- At Kola Peninsula the first pattern
- In Nenetsia the second pattern
- Not enough data from Siberia, but something is going on

Is this Russian influence?

---

- The fact that this pronunciation is not common on the areas where Iźva spread over non-Russian speaking areas could also be used to argue it is related to Russian indeed.
- Some evidence suggest that similar phenomena would be going on also on other Komi dialect under more-than-ordinary Russian influence -- Upper-Sysola (this has been attested on few speakers in Užga vilalge) [@uotila1986a].

## Fast comparison

```{r reality_check , echo=F, warning=F, message=F, comment=F}
data_frame(value = c("Russian phonemes", "more than usual Russian lexicon", "Palatalization of sibilants", "wovel change in pal. env."),
           `Iźva` = c("f, x, ts", "TRUE", "TRUE", "ɕöd > sʲed"),
           `Upper-Sysola` = c("f, x", "TRUE", "TRUE", "ɲaɲ > ɲeɲ, jaj > jej"))  %>% tibble::column_to_rownames("value") %>% knitr::kable()
```

- In Iźva palatalization seems to co-occur areally with extended deaffricatization.
- For history of deaffricatization in Iźva, compare to Upper-Vym [@batalova1982RU, 53], but [@redei1978a] and [@kpv_vym19570000-290_3a-Soska]).

## Adaptation of Russian elements

- There has been contact between Komi and Russian since 12th century [@leinonen2006b, 235]
- Russian loans also are similarly layered
    + Old dialectal loans: челядь 'children'
    + Relatively new loans, but well adapted to Komi
    + Of course lots of loans are just passing through Russian, cf. /interesnəj/ (compare [@kalima1910a])
- Relative similarity between Komi and Russian phonologies

- Compare rus. respublika, kpv. respublika, sah. öröspüübülüke [@ferguson2016a, 146]
- Lots of linguistic resources bivalent [@woolard1998a, 7], but here the devices to enforce distinctions are very subtle
- Compare: kpv. /ɕemja/, rus. /sʲemʲja/, orthographically [семъя] ]and [семья]


##

- Our corpus tries, probably failingly but with honest attempt, to capture something about the multilinguality of these speech communities.
- If someone speaks only Russian we still carry on the recording to the end, as there is often wealth of information about the linguistic situation in the community, among other things

## Different languages -- Komi

- Drawing line between languages probably not fruitful
- However, I've indicated to the corpus when someone is speaking only Russian in order to distinguish that in the searches

`r gloss("muʒik-ɨs pəgibnit-is sɨ-lɨ lokt-is izveɕenʲ:e poxoronka", "man-3SG die-3SG.PST she-3SG.DAT arrive-3SG.PST notice funeral", "Her husband died, she received a letter (from the front).")`

`r gloss("tak vot kər kak tseloveka vedʲ", "FOC FOC reindeer Q human FOC", "Well the reindeer is like a human, right.")`

`r gloss('и ныа тулыс-эдз обычнэ мыйке , благовешеннеас вед седьмого апреля , да ?', 'and they spring-TERM' usually something PUNCT Annunciation FOC seven.GEN April.GEN PUNCT yes PUNCT', 'And usually by the summer they (do) something, the Annunciation is seventh of April, right?')`

## Data use

```{r, echo=F}
kpv <- readr::read_rds("/Volumes/langdoc/langs/kpv/kpv_izva_corpus.rds")
threshold <- 1300
kpv %>% filter(attr_foreign != T) %>% 
        filter(aligned == TRUE) %>%
        filter(rating > 0) %>%
        count(participant) %>%
#        filter(n > threshold) %>%
        .$participant -> top_participants

kpv %>% filter(participant %in% top_participants) -> kpv_selection

```

- Subset selected by few criteria
    - Has to be time-aligned
    - Audio quality has to be sufficient
    - The amount of tokens per speaker has to be substantial

In the corpus there are currently `r length(kpv_selection %>% distinct(participant))` speakers who fill the criteria needed. I have sampled their speech,  in hope of getting enough occurrences of different loantypes to get some meaningful results. Besides I selected three speakers from different geographic locations to get more detailed view of what is going on.

##

```{r, echo=F}
# kpv_selection %>% distinct(participant, lon_birth, lat_birth, session_name) %>% filter(is.na(lon_birth))
# kpv_selection %>% filter(participant == "MSF-F-1968") %>% distinct(participant, lon_por, lat_por, session_name) %>% slice(20:22)
basemap %>% addCircleMarkers(data = kpv %>% 
                                     tidyr::drop_na(lon_birth) %>% 
                                     filter(attr_foreign != T) %>% 
                                     filter(aligned == TRUE), 
                             lng = ~lon_birth, lat = ~lat_birth, radius = 2)

## Testing

- Some cases more bivalent than others, especially nominatives
- However, as both languages have quite rich morphology, one often has to make further decisions
- I was interested about whether there is a salient difference in phonological adaptation between cases like: восьмого ~ восьмойын, or газет ~ газетсьыс ~ газеты, or посёлку ~ посёлокас, or российская ~ россияса, or северные ~ севернӧй
- Sampling different types and looking into them more closely
    + Not that simple with corpus that's still under construction!
- Sample has been pre-filtered by few conditions
    + No only Russian texts
    + No tokens from foreign researchers (me, Michael Rießler and Rogier Blokland)
    + No tokens from data which has no audio alignment
    + No tokens from direct linguistic elicititation
    + No Saami or Nenets
 - Apparently this kind of selection is ok when reasoned well enough [@johnson2008a]
