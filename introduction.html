<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 2</span> Introduction</h1>
<!-- <center><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="abstract.pdf"></iframe></center> -->
<p>The sociolinguistic variation in Uralic languages like Komi is basically uninvestigated, so there are many different phenomena one should look into. Large degree of variation found in contemporary spoken Komi has a clear areal origin – different dialectal features are present although they fuse with more standard features, and are more salient in some registers and speech events than in the others. In contemporary Russia we often find speech communities which are quite different from those one would assume on traditionally described homogenous dialect areas. The mobility during Soviet times has been relatively high, and in areas like Komi the state enforced relocations have often resulted in Komi speakers being shuffled from one community to another.</p>
<p>At the same time one should not underestimate the mobility of speakers in earlier times, as there is ample evidence from large migrations and regular resettlements all over Komi area. Probably the traditional dialect areas never were as neat as they plot over on a map. Also seeing the dialect areas in their exact geographical context in relation to roads and trade connections could give some insight</p>
<p>This leads into a situation where individual variation can often be pin pointed into personal backgrounds. For example, someone may have lived long time on another region or someone’s parents may have moved from elsewhere. These trajectories contribute on different ways to the ways how people speak. There are several good examples in current Komi corpus. For example, one speaker from <a href="link%20here">Vizinga region</a> did most of his working career in <a href="link%20here">Ižma region</a>, and his speech is wonderful fusion of <a href="link%20here">Central Sysola morphology</a> with Iźva lexicon and syntactic pecularities. One could think speakers like him as exceptions, but in reality it must have been always the norm that mobility like this has always been present in the community.</p>
<p>This study in hand is not yet entirely finished, and as it is first of the attempts to study sociolinguistic variation in Komi dialects, it could also be considered as a pilot study of a sort. Thereby all comments about methodology and possible different approaches would be most welcome.</p>
<p>I start this study with citation from one of the conversations which initially pointed me that this phenomena exists. One of my Komi teachers in Syktyvkar, folklorist Valentina Viktorovna, once recalled after day’s lectures how she had encountered different patterns of pronunciation, in this case in Siberia.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kpv_izva20111014VVF-1"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that pronunciations such as [sʲələm] this pronounciation i completetely strange and they want me to write something sodo occur on different speakers, but the most common environment is that where a speaker imitates how the Komi on other regions speak. In most of the examples it is somehow discussed with the deaffricatization on those areas. Generally speaking when I’ve been discussing this phenomena with different speakers the results have been quite mixed. Some are conscious about this variation, but the most apparently are not, and as said very often it is associated somehow vaguely with deaffricatization as an areal feature, contributing together with that to general perception of “softness” of the periferic Iźva varieties.</p>
<p>This kind of pronunciation is indeed present on some speakers of Komi. One encounters it on peripheric regions where Iźva Komi is spoken, however, not all speakers exhibit it. Moreover some speakers have similar pronunciation also elsewhere. Among different areas one where I have encountered it often is Upper-Sysola – dialectologically very different corner from Iźva. However, that is also a region where the contact with Russian has been long, so one could think that this development is connected to Russian contact.</p>
<p>Yet another environment where this kind of pronunciation seems to occur is with the speakers who have not acquired Komi perfectly as children, and whose main language is Russian. However, this case is still wholly different from what I discuss here most of the time, since imperfect language acquisition does not seem to be involved that often with the changes on communal level.</p>
<p>Even among the speakers who normally in their Komi never exhibit Russian-like palatalized pronunciation in their Komi this of course surfaces in their Russian. And the line between Komi and Russian is very blurry and easily crossed. We have been working recently with Boglarka Janurik to establish some conventions to tag mixed morphology and code-switching in Erzya and Komi, and hopefully the current study can be somehow combined into this.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Background</h2>
<p>I started to study Komi roughly six years ago. During these years I was living in Syktyvkar for five months and have later been involved with around eight fieldtrips in different regions where Komi is spoken. I’ve worked with Komi both in urban and rural areas, and although my later work has been conducted mainly on the countryside, I think the processes taking place among urban Komi are also very much in need of investigations. Also these categorizations are often somewhat vague, as many villages are close to the cities and people tend to have complex backgrounds.</p>
<p>I remember spendings lots of time with Komi speakers at the University and at different cultural institutions. Although Russian loanwords are used everywhere, I was even surprised by the stark contrast many speakers exhibited when speaking at their workplace in contrast to the way how they spoke, for example, when having a drink with the friends. Naturally there is nothing surprising in this fact, native speakers employ different registers in different settings, but I started to get impression that the way Russian terms are used and adapted is somehow closely connected to the way how different registers work.</p>
</div>
<div id="multilinguality-as-a-resource" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Multilinguality as a resource</h2>
<p>If we think about the the principal goal of the language documentation, which Himmelmann pronounced as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to provide a comprehensive record of the linguistic practices characteristic of a given speech community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it is quite obvious that if the language community is multilingual, then also the linguistic practices in it are necessarily multilingual, and it logically follows that monolingual corpus cannot describe adequately these linguistic practices. It may be adequate in order to describe the grammatical system of a given language, but these linguistic practices we are supposedly after must be something quite different.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that we would be doing perfect job in this either. Our Komi corpus is primarily in Komi Zyrian dialects. However, there are very large amounts of Russian within it. And also small fragments of other languages. Currently the corpus contains material in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Komi</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Tundra Nenets</li>
<li>Mansi</li>
<li>Kildin Saami</li>
<li>Finnish</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are truly fragmentary, for example, some Komi speakers who know Finnish have uttered few sentences to clarify some point for me. In Nenets we have few poems, in Mansi one song. One could say that this is next to nothing, and truly, these may not always be enough to get very comprehensive results (besides with Komi and Russian which both are plentiful), but ideally the Nenets, Saami, Khanty and Mansi portions of the corpus would grow so that the multilingualism within these languages could also be better investigated.</p>
</div>
<div id="transcription-system" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Transcription system</h2>
<p>Uralic Phonetic Alphabet (henceforth UPA) is commonly used transcription system in Uralistics. It is very exact and in all real applications interchangeable with IPA. The main issue I see with UPA is that it is used in widely different manner by different researchers in the descriptions of different languages. This creates rather good uniformity within language varieties, i.e. transcribed Komi follows more or less the same conventions, as does transcribed Meadow Mari or Tundra Nenets, but these transcriptions are not easily comparable. And although being very exact in many nuances, it is well known that UPA does not distinguish <strong>palatal place of articulation</strong> from <strong>palatalized manner of articulation</strong>. Thereby following grapheme when used in transcription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ś</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could represent either phones</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sʲ or ɕ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are very few languages in which these variants would be phonemically distinct. Naturally one can always come up with ad-hoc conventions to mark these differences, but this again feeds to the problem I described above: lack of comparability between transcripts.</p>
<p>Now some words are needed about the palatal sibilant in Komi. There are cases where it is described as <a href="http://phoible.org/inventories/view/426">ç</a> or something else.</p>
<p>In Iźva Komi Documentation Project we have employed a transcription system which is close to Komi orthography. For dialectal phonological deviations the conventions chosen are similar to those in recent Komi dialect dictionary. The convention is great for morphological and syntactic work, but there are several difficulties with phonological studies. As has been pointed out, more narrow transcriptions helps greatly while identifying how the variation is connected to different phonetic environments. However, this may contain much information that is not needed on the later research. <span class="citation">(Milroy and Gordon <a href="#ref-milroyEtAl2003a">2003</a>, 143)</span>. Actually it could be a very good convention if language documentation corpora would contain a small carefully selected subset of very narrowly transcribed recordings.</p>
<p>The approach selected here has been to use the current transcription system to identify locations where the sibilants under investigation occur, and those tokens are transcribed narrowly in IPA. Especially in the earlier phases Praat has been used to evaluate the variables in different environments, but the majority of annotations have been done based on auditory judgment. As this is easily highly biased, the transcriptions were later evaluated by another highly proficient listener. To add transcparency, the time aligned and transcribed tokens can also be listened online. As always, feedback is most welcome. I have used an R function to transform orthographic transcription into rudimentary IPA, which has been re-evaluated while the tokens containing sibilants have been time-aligned.</p>
<div id="transcription-system" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Transcription system used in this study</h3>
<p>The transcription system used in Iźva Komi Documentation Project is in Cyrillic and it follows closely the conventions of Komi orthography. It is the same transcription system used in new Komi dialect dictionaries published recently <span class="citation">(Безносикова Л. М. AND Айбабина <a href="#ref-beznosikovaEtAl2012a">2012</a>)</span>. It doesn’t mark allophonic variatian, but captures Komi phoneme inventory in a very satisfactory manner. As every pohonene is represented, it is possible to convert this transcription into other transcription systems, such as IPA or UPA. In this study I have used IPA as described in the International Phonetic Association’s handbook <span class="citation">(International Phonetic Association <a href="#ref-ipa1999a">1999</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Cyrillic transcription used in IKDP is essentially phonemic, but due to conventions of Cyrillic orthography there is no one-to-one correspondence between the characters used. Instead, there are complex one-to-many correspondences, which nevertheless are systematic and resolving between these should, in principle, be possible in all cases. There are some corner cases and murky areas in Komi phonology, but in the larger picture those do not problematize the situation too much. There are several good reasons to select Cyrillic based orthography in the first place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthography represents already Komi phoneme inventory very well</li>
<li>There is already good amount of language technology around Komi Zyrian written language, using Cyrillic transcription makes that compatible</li>
<li>Native speakers have more immediate access to the data</li>
<li>Cyrillic transcription is relatively ignorant about the realizations of underlying allophones, so one can conveniently remain at the phoneme level without putting spoon into too many soups</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="phenomena" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Phenomena</h2>
<p>Russian and Komi have relatively similar phonological distinction between plain velars and their “soft” variants. Orthographically they are marked similarly in both languages, using same conventions of Cyrillic orhography. The actual realizations of the phones, the allophones, within these phonemes are often rather distinct, Russian phoneme usually being rather prototypical alveolar palatalized sibilant /sʲ/. In Komi the phoneme in question is relatively different /ɕ/. Russian also contains phone [ɕ:], phonemic status of which seems to be debated <span class="citation">(Chew <a href="#ref-chew2003a">2003</a>, 64)</span>, marked with Cyrillic grapheme &lt;щ&gt;. This phone seems to be very close to the phoneme /ɕ/ found in Komi.</p>
<!-- prostoj : proɕ:e 
     osʲenʲ : osʲenʲu-
     счастье > [ˈɕːæsʲtʲjə] 
     -->
<p>The linguistic variable my investigation focuses into is this relatively simple alterations in the sibilant articulation. It is possible to analyze it as variation between two variants, although acoustically the phenomena is little bit more complicated as some pronunciations are kind of in-between. However, in the majority of cases it is relatively straightforward to assign one value or another.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Research questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the variation connected to language contact</li>
<li>If so, is Russian the source language</li>
<li>How this variation can be described</li>
<li>What is the areal scope of this variation</li>
<li>What is the temporal scope of this variation</li>
<li>Is the variant sociolinguistically significant</li>
</ul>
<p>If some of these questions cannot be answered, the reasons to this would also be worth its own investigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Data</h2>
<p>All my data comes from Iźva Komi Documentation Project which has been funded by Kone Foundation in 2014-2016 and led by Rogier Blokland, Michael Rießler and Marina Fedina. For the first two years of the project I worked in it as a full time PhD student, and my tasks were closely connected to curating, extending and annotating the Komi corpus in question. The project has collected large amount of new data from the areas where Iźva Komi is spoken, but at the same time it is closely connected to older data sources. Naturally, there is no thinking that we would be the first researchers collecting data from these speech varieties – already M.A. Castrén wrote his grammar based to this variery <span class="citation">(Castren <a href="#ref-castren1844a">1844</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Although the majority of our effort has gone to working with our own data, we have also incorporated to the corpus data from variety of older sources. We have prioritized the data for which audio recordings exist, but even the materials with no audio can be extremely valuable. Naturally with mere transcriptions there arises the issue of verification – it is not possible to examine more closely what lies behind the transcribed segments. On the other hand, I think we must start our work with the expectation that the scholars who have worked before us must have had similarly high standards as we do. In some sense also quantity can be used to verify the quality, as the transcriptions which show systematic patterns in larger amounts of text are very likely valid. More so if these patterns are somehow connected to what can be observed in the current and contemporary recordings.</p>
<p>The availability of earlier materials makes contemporary language corpora very heterogenic. Or better to say, they have the potential to do this. Many corpora are still created on basis of individual recording sessions in a fairly traditional settings, but as the world is full of online resources and printed materials, one is often tempted to include these into corpus whenever possible. This makes corpus curation more complicated task, and it demands that the corpus user has some access and understanding of the overall structure of the corpus. In real world applications the data selected for research use would often be a sample from the complete corpus. This sounds in many ways like a normal scientific procedure, so I think one can assume that’s a good way to go.</p>
<p>In my case the most important subcorpora have been the Nenets Autonomous Okrug section of Iźva Komi Documentation Project, transcriptions provided in Syrjänische Texte II by T.E. Uotila, the recordings of Eric Vászolyi from Kanin Peninsula and Kolva region, and the TV broadcasts of Radio Yamala in early winter of 2016.</p>
