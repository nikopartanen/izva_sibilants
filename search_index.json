I’ve been working with it quite a while, and it connects in many ways to my PhD studies. Actually this page contains the whole study as it is, in whatever messy state it is, and Git version control allows tracing it back to the first lines I wrote. Scary, but in some sense also reassuring. At the moment I have the data locally, but in the later phase also this will be connected to a repository where it can be accessed, at least after request in case some materials cannot be openly shared. Open science has to look something like this, so that our data is available, as is our analysis and the road we took to get into it. Quite a long time has passed since I submitted the abstract first time, and not everything has gone exactly as one would had thought. I thought I would had had a possibility to gather more data from Komi in Siberia, but we had many good reasons to work in Kola Peninsula during summer 2016 instead. Also many preliminary results have gone to the trashbin over and over again, but most of the ideas I propose still seem to hold. I’m also expanding the question further from the sibilant articulation to other aspects of Komi phonology in contact with Russian. That said, many other questions are also getting so complex that they would deserve their own studies altogether. One of the key reasons to manage the project this way publicly in GitHub is that it ensures the reproducibility of the study. It isn’t necessarily so important for the others, but it is also easier for me to manage what is going on while the project is rigorously under version control. And so is the language documentation corpus the study is based upon. It is natural that in many cases the researchers cannot share all of their raw data, the main reasons being connected to the rights of those individuals from who the data has been collected. This is of course normal in human sciences. Sharing the research in prose form is also a norm, but as the datasets used are getting more complicated, there is also more use of computational tools. Sharing these tools should be as natural as sharing the more literal content of your work. This is one way to do it nicely, in my opinion. 1.1 Abstract The Uralic language Komi Zyrian distinguishes several palatal consonants as their own phonemes. This differs from the palatalized consonants found in Russian. In some varieties of the Iźva dialect, the sibilants /ɕ/ and /ʑ/ have shifted to a palatalized manner of articulation. This feature is often characteristic of the Komi spoken in Western Siberia and on the Kanin and Kola Peninsulas. It is also clear that other authors have perceived this difference, i.e. by transcribing with /ś/ and /š́/ what presumably is the difference between /sʲ/ and /ɕ/ (cf. Iźva varieties in (Uotila 1986) with many different sibilant allophones). Native speakers also occasionally comment on this feature. This change is likely, though not necessarily, induced by Russian contact. As a change within allophonic variants, this change has had no impact on the Komi phonological system. To make a comparison, this already makes the contact outcome different from that of other Uralic language, Kildin Saami, where Russian influence has slightly changed the phonotaxis of palatalized consonants, among other things, as analyzed by Blokland et al. (2011, 16) and Kuzmenko et al. (2012). I have examined this phenomenon in connection with the adaptation of Russian loanwords in spoken Komi. The latter topic has generally received some attention, i.e. (J. A. Igušev 1972); for an overview of the language contact situation, see (Leinonen 2009). Due to bilingualism, Komi speakers always have the option of pronouncing the sibilants in lexical items such as ‘September’ following the Russian or Komi model, respectively /sʲenʲtʲabrʲ/ or /ɕeɲcabr/, with variation in levels of adaptation. When analyzed in a modern sociolinguistic framework where variables are seen as expressions of styles and social identities, not as permanent attributes of the speakers, e.g. (Eckert 2012, 93–94), this variation can be described within the context where it occurs. Among the relevant factors, formality seems to be salient: speech in an educational setting, official speeches or interviews exhibit more standard Komi pronunciation than informal conversations. The social relevance of this variation is connected to the perception that the palatalized pronunciation is not native to Komi. However, while the palatalized pronunciation can be perceived as a Russian accent, an overly Komi pronunciation of Russian lexical items can also be interpreted as an inability to pronounce Russian – something that seems to be poorly accepted in modern Russia. One must also note that for some speakers the palatalized pronunciation can be considered the unmarked variant. The analysis is based on a transcribed corpus of spoken Iźva Komi collected as part of a research project funded by Kone Foundation between 2014 and 2016. This larger body of data has been sampled so that there are examples from different age groups and different areas where Iźva Komi is spoken. Tools of phonetic analysis are used to measure the different variables and the distribution and relevance of the results are validated with statistical tests. In 2016, the material will be stored and archived in different repositories with the rest of the Komi corpus, making them available for scientific use and ensuring the reproducibility of the research.

Large degree of variation found in contemporary spoken Komi has a clear areal origin – different dialectal features are present although they fuse with more standard features, and are more salient in some registers and speech events than in the others. In contemporary Russia we often find speech communities which are quite different from those one would assume on traditionally described homogenous dialect areas. The mobility during Soviet times has been relatively high, and in areas like Komi the state enforced relocations have often resulted in Komi speakers being shuffled from one community to another, mixing dialects as this happens. On the other hand, standard language has had some influence to local varieties as well, although less so with areas outside Komi Republic (Tsypanov 2009). At the same time one should not underestimate the mobility of speakers in earlier times, as there is ample evidence from large migrations and regular resettlements all over Komi area. Probably the traditional dialect areas never were as neat as they plot over on a map. Also seeing the dialect areas in their exact geographical context in relation to roads and trade connections could give some insight This leads into a situation where individual variation can often be pin pointed into personal backgrounds. For example, someone may have lived long time on another region or someone’s parents may have moved from elsewhere. These trajectories contribute on different ways to the ways how people speak. There are several good examples in current Komi corpus. For example, one speaker from Vizinga region did most of his working career in Ižma region, and his speech is wonderful fusion of Central Sysola morphology with Iźva lexicon and syntactic pecularities. One could think speakers like him as exceptions, but in reality it must have been always the norm that mobility like this has always been present in the community. This study in hand is not yet entirely finished, and as it is first of the attempts to study sociolinguistic variation in Komi dialects, it could also be considered as a pilot study of a sort. Thereby all comments about methodology and possible different approaches would be most welcome. I start this study with citation from one of the conversations which initially pointed me that this phenomena exists. One of my Komi teachers in Syktyvkar, folklorist Valentina Viktorovna, once recalled after day’s lectures how she had encountered different patterns of pronunciation, in this case in Siberia. ipa ft_eng vot nalən sʲələm, sʲələm da, vot menam zev una mɨjkə, Well they say “heart”, “heart”, yes, I have many examples. i najə viɕtalənɨ “mi praviʎna ɕorɲitam, mi koʎim vaʒsə”, me ʃua “kuʧəma ti praviʎnəja?” And they say: “We speak correctly, we retained the old (way)”, and I say: “how do you speak correctly?” a seni eməɕ ətkɨmɨn jəz kodjas And there are some people who, ʃuam pərɨɕʤɨkjas, i naja mian moznas ɕorɲitənɨ. let’s say the older, and they speak in our way. a tomjasɨs uʒe nalən sʲəʎəm, puksʲɨ, vot sidʒi najə uʒe ɕorɲitənɨ But the youngs, they already have “heart”, “sit down”, well this is how they already speak. da, sɨ vösna mɨj nalən ötɨk rot͡ɕ vlʲejanije Yes, because they have one Russian influence. məd kə vidʲimo xantɨ mansʲi ɲeɲeckəjɨs toʒə kuʧəmakə petkət͡ɕːə On the other hand Khanty, Mansi and Nenets (influence) comes out. (???) It is noteworthy that pronunciations such as [sʲələm] this pronounciation occurs on different speakers, but the most common environment is that where a speaker imitates how the Komi on other regions speak. In most of the examples it is somehow discussed with the deaffricatization on those areas. Generally speaking when I’ve been discussing this phenomena with different speakers the results have been quite mixed. Some are conscious about this variation, but the most apparently are not, and as said very often it is associated somehow vaguely with deaffricatization as an areal feature, contributing together with that to general perception of “softness” of the periferic Iźva varieties. This kind of pronunciation is indeed present on some speakers of Komi. One encounters it on peripheric regions where Iźva Komi is spoken, however, not all speakers exhibit it. Moreover some speakers have similar pronunciation also elsewhere. Among different areas one where I have encountered it often is Upper-Sysola – dialectologically very different corner from Iźva. However, that is also a region where the contact with Russian has been long, so one could think that this development is connected to Russian contact. Same can be said about the Inva region of Komi-Permyak, where similar phenomena has been reported. Yet another environment where this kind of pronunciation seems to occur is with the speakers who have not acquired Komi perfectly as children, and whose main language is Russian. However, this case is still wholly different from what I discuss here most of the time, since imperfect language acquisition does not seem to be involved that often with the changes on communal level. Even among the speakers who normally in their Komi never exhibit Russian-like palatalized pronunciation in their Komi this of course surfaces in their Russian. And the line between Komi and Russian is very blurry and easily crossed. We have been working recently with Boglarka Janurik to establish some conventions to tag mixed morphology and code-switching in Erzya and Komi, and hopefully the current study can be somehow combined into this. It seems, after discussing this with many Komi speakers, that this pronunciation as such is not strongly noticed by the speakers themselves, and often when I try to ask about it I encounter just bewilderment. So in this sense it doesn’t look like a feature that would likely be strongly sociolinguistically marked. However, the way how it directly associates with Russian pronunciation still makes it interesting. 2.1 Background I started to study Komi roughly six years ago. During these years I was living in Syktyvkar for five months and have later been involved with around eight fieldtrips in different regions where Komi is spoken. I’ve worked with Komi both in urban and rural areas, and although my later work has been conducted mainly on the countryside, I think the processes taking place among urban Komi are also very much in need of investigations. Also these categorizations are often somewhat vague, as many villages are close to the cities and people tend to have complex backgrounds. I remember spendings lots of time with Komi speakers at the University and at different cultural institutions. Although Russian loanwords are used everywhere, I was even surprised by the stark contrast many speakers exhibited when speaking at their workplace in contrast to the way how they spoke, for example, when having a drink with the friends. Naturally there is nothing surprising in this fact, native speakers employ different registers in different settings, but I started to get impression that the way Russian terms are used and adapted is somehow closely connected to the way how different registers work. 2.2 Multilinguality as a resource If we think about the the principal goal of the language documentation, which Himmelmann pronounced as: to provide a comprehensive record of the linguistic practices characteristic of a given speech community. Then it is quite obvious that if the language community is multilingual, then also the linguistic practices in it are necessarily multilingual, and it logically follows that monolingual corpus cannot describe adequately these linguistic practices. It may be adequate in order to describe the grammatical system of a given language, but these linguistic practices we are supposedly after must be something quite different. I’m not saying that we would be doing perfect job in this either. Our Komi corpus is primarily in Komi Zyrian dialects. However, there are very large amounts of Russian within it. And also small fragments of other languages. Currently the corpus contains material in: Komi Russian Tundra Nenets Mansi Kildin Saami Finnish Some of these are truly fragmentary, for example, some Komi speakers who know Finnish have uttered few sentences to clarify some point for me. In Nenets we have few poems, in Mansi one song. One could say that this is next to nothing, and truly, these may not always be enough to get very comprehensive results (besides with Komi and Russian which both are plentiful), but ideally the Nenets, Saami, Khanty and Mansi portions of the corpus would grow so that the multilingualism within these languages could also be better investigated. 2.3 Transcription system Uralic Phonetic Alphabet (henceforth UPA) is commonly used transcription system in Uralistics. It is very exact and in all real applications interchangeable with IPA. The main issue I see with UPA is that it is used in widely different manner by different researchers in the descriptions of different languages. This creates rather good uniformity within language varieties, i.e. transcribed Komi follows more or less the same conventions, as does transcribed Meadow Mari or Tundra Nenets, but these transcriptions are not easily comparable. And although being very exact in many nuances, it is well known that UPA does not distinguish palatal place of articulation from palatalized manner of articulation. Thereby following grapheme when used in transcription: ś Could represent either phones sʲ or ɕ There are very few languages in which these variants would be phonemically distinct. Naturally one can always come up with ad-hoc conventions to mark these differences, but this again feeds to the problem I described above: lack of comparability between transcripts. Now some words are needed about the palatal sibilant in Komi. There are cases where it is described as ç or something else. In Iźva Komi Documentation Project we have employed a transcription system which is close to Komi orthography. For dialectal phonological deviations the conventions chosen are similar to those in recent Komi dialect dictionary. The convention is great for morphological and syntactic work, but there are several difficulties with phonological studies. As has been pointed out, more narrow transcriptions helps greatly while identifying how the variation is connected to different phonetic environments. However, this may contain much information that is not needed on the later research. (Milroy and Gordon 2003, 143). Actually it could be a very good convention if language documentation corpora would contain a small carefully selected subset of very narrowly transcribed recordings. The approach selected here has been to use the current transcription system to identify locations where the sibilants under investigation occur, and those tokens are transcribed narrowly in IPA. Especially in the earlier phases Praat has been used to evaluate the variables in different environments, but the majority of annotations have been done based on auditory judgment. As this is easily highly biased, the transcriptions were later evaluated by another highly proficient listener. To add transcparency, the time aligned and transcribed tokens can also be listened online. As always, feedback is most welcome. I have used an R function to transform orthographic transcription into rudimentary IPA, which has been re-evaluated while the tokens containing sibilants have been time-aligned. 2.3.1 Transcription system used in this study The transcription system used in Iźva Komi Documentation Project is in Cyrillic and it follows closely the conventions of Komi orthography. It is the same transcription system used in new Komi dialect dictionaries published recently (Безносикова Л. М. AND Айбабина 2012). It doesn’t mark allophonic variatian, but captures Komi phoneme inventory in a very satisfactory manner. As every pohonene is represented, it is possible to convert this transcription into other transcription systems, such as IPA or UPA. In this study I have used IPA as described in the International Phonetic Association’s handbook (International Phonetic Association 1999). The Cyrillic transcription used in IKDP is essentially phonemic, but due to conventions of Cyrillic orthography there is no one-to-one correspondence between the characters used. Instead, there are complex one-to-many correspondences, which nevertheless are systematic and resolving between these should, in principle, be possible in all cases. There are some corner cases and murky areas in Komi phonology, but in the larger picture those do not problematize the situation too much. There are several good reasons to select Cyrillic based orthography in the first place: Orthography represents already Komi phoneme inventory very well There is already good amount of language technology around Komi Zyrian written language, using Cyrillic transcription makes that compatible Native speakers have more immediate access to the data Cyrillic transcription is relatively ignorant about the realizations of underlying allophones, so one can conveniently remain at the phoneme level without putting spoon into too many soups 2.4 Phenomena Russian and Komi have relatively similar phonological distinction between plain velars and their “soft” variants. Orthographically they are marked similarly in both languages, using same conventions of Cyrillic orhography. The actual realizations of the phones, the allophones, within these phonemes are often rather distinct, Russian phoneme usually being rather prototypical alveolar palatalized sibilant /sʲ/. In Komi the phoneme in question is relatively different /ɕ/. Russian also contains phone [ɕ:], phonemic status of which seems to be debated (Chew 2003, 64), marked with Cyrillic grapheme &lt;щ&gt;. This phone seems to be very close to the phoneme /ɕ/ found in Komi. [ˈɕːæsʲtʲjə] --> The linguistic variable my investigation focuses into is this relatively simple alterations in the sibilant articulation. It is possible to analyze it as variation between two variants, although acoustically the phenomena is little bit more complicated as some pronunciations are kind of in-between. However, in the majority of cases it is relatively straightforward to assign one value or another. 2.5 Research questions Is the variation connected to language contact If so, is Russian the source language How this variation can be described What is the areal scope of this variation What is the temporal scope of this variation Is the variant sociolinguistically significant If some of these questions cannot be answered, the reasons to this would also be worth its own investigation. 2.6 Data All my data comes from Iźva Komi Documentation Project which has been funded by Kone Foundation in 2014-2016 and led by Rogier Blokland, Michael Rießler and Marina Fedina. For the first two years of the project I worked in it as a full time PhD student, and my tasks were closely connected to curating, extending and annotating the Komi corpus in question. The project has collected large amount of new data from the areas where Iźva Komi is spoken, but at the same time it is closely connected to older data sources. Naturally, there is no thinking that we would be the first researchers collecting data from these speech varieties – already M.A. Castrén wrote his grammar based to this variery (Castren 1844). Although the majority of our effort has gone to working with our own data, we have also incorporated to the corpus data from variety of older sources. We have prioritized the data for which audio recordings exist, but even the materials with no audio can be extremely valuable. Naturally with mere transcriptions there arises the issue of verification – it is not possible to examine more closely what lies behind the transcribed segments. On the other hand, I think we must start our work with the expectation that the scholars who have worked before us must have had similarly high standards as we do. In some sense also quantity can be used to verify the quality, as the transcriptions which show systematic patterns in larger amounts of text are very likely valid. More so if these patterns are somehow connected to what can be observed in the current and contemporary recordings. The availability of earlier materials makes contemporary language corpora very heterogenic. Or better to say, they have the potential to do this. Many corpora are still created on basis of individual recording sessions in a fairly traditional settings, but as the world is full of online resources and printed materials, one is often tempted to include these into corpus whenever possible. This makes corpus curation more complicated task, and it demands that the corpus user has some access and understanding of the overall structure of the corpus. In real world applications the data selected for research use would often be a sample from the complete corpus. This sounds in many ways like a normal scientific procedure, so I think one can assume that’s a good way to go. In my case the most important subcorpora have been the Nenets Autonomous Okrug section of Iźva Komi Documentation Project, transcriptions provided in Syrjänische Texte II by T.E. Uotila, the recordings of Eric Vászolyi from Kanin Peninsula and Kolva region, and the TV broadcasts of Radio Yamala in early winter of 2016. 2.6.1 Open issues with data Lack of data from Russian dialects What are the limitations of language documentation corpora How to differentiate Russian loanwords from already native elements (for example, very old opaque loanwords) References "],

In no context the absence of the sound can be a variable, so it is possible to traverse from phonological transcription to individual occurrences. However, one could argue that the dataset used is not entirely traditional. Language documentation goals are generally described as striving to create a multipurpose data, but at the same time the target is also descriptive and aims to produce relatively standard grammars and lexical resources. In this sense studying the variation with more sociolinguistic toolkit can be seen as somewhat non-standard use of language documentation data and also contributes to the idea of multipurpose data. However, there are some issues related to the fact that data has not been gathered as a resource for variational study. I’ve tried to keep the analysis section very uncomplicated, although there are issues which have been dealt with as they have become apparent. Should the names be included in the analysis? Some are truly ambivalent and are pronounced quite identically in both languages, at least to the degree that there are no phonemes which would demand radical amount of adaptation (yes, the stress still differs) What to do with ubiguous forms like сет? Current solution: leave them out (сила, сет) What all has to be resolved due the multilingualism of the dataset (even small amount of Nenets within Komi) There are two annotated variants and all occurrences in the corpus are taken into account, although the more standard Komi pronunciation is overwhelmingly the most common in data. I have not found occurrences where the realization of the variable could be zero, so I’m quite confident I’ve captured all occurrences in my annotations. I have described the procedure how variables are selected in section 3.5 about ELAN annotations. It is also assumed that these variants are functionally equivalent, so that there are no obvious differences in meaning. This variable is also good for investigation as it is very common – palatal sibilants are very typical phonemes in the Permic languages and thereby occur in all recordings. The choice of variable was very much influenced by the procedure described by Tagliamonte (2006, 70-). However, in the initial stage of the study it was clear to me that there is something going on with the sibilants, it was only after later analysis of the data during which I started to understand different variables which seem to be interacting here. Parts of the region studied are under the influence of Komi written standard, but in the peripheric regions Komi is not widely teached, and if it is, the variety is often the local dialect. This has impact to how conscious the individuals are about the norms of the standard language (Milroy and Milroy 1997, 75) . There have been earlier reports about the spread of standard language variants within Komi Republic, especially within lexical items. However, Cypanov also mentions his observations how also at the Komi countryside the standard language would be connected to the speakers’ educational level, but at the same time in some regions (Luza, Udora and Iźva being listed as examples) the local dialects also compete with the literary standard in their value and authority. (Tsypanov 2009, 215). So the institutional endorsement of standard is present for some local varieties only, which is salient in the sense that also the local dialect embracement can be seen as a reaction to the standardization demands. If it is a counterreaction, it may not be similarly present in the areas where the original catalyst for it is missing. It must also be taken into account that the variation within endangered language may not be entirely as expected from larger languages. Lyle Campbell has even recently suggested that the variation within endangered languages may not even be regular (Campbell 2016, 257–59). Campbell gives examples from several languages, and it seems clear that for example the variation in the speech of semi-speakers may not fit any regular pattern. The process likely has something to do with the fragmentation of community which seems to be taking places in many language endangerment situations. We wrote recently about this with Janne Saarikivi (Partanen and Saarikivi 2016), and our investigation of the social networks in a fixed neighbourhood shows clearly that the assumptions of who is Karelian speaker are getting very detached from the actual reality of who would be a speaker, and the language ends up being used in very closed and heterogenous groups which are not aware about each others. The language acquisition and use takes place in these micro-networks within the larger community, which makes it not surprising if the patterns in speech are not very logical community wide. Maybe instead of irregularity the factors influencing the language use have just became too complex and fragmented to be easily studied? Already some fifteen years ago Heikki Paunonen has commented that “overflowing variation is a sign of crisis in the language community” (Paunonen 2000), and probably one could trace down more comments along these lines in the literature. However, generally speaking one could say that small endangered languages are kind of treasure troves on which one can use the methods of variationistic studies. It is not uncommon that different grammars and list variables and phenomena which are in free variation. 3.2 Methodological implementation Methodology always has two aspects – scientific and technical. Milroy and Gordon pose the following question (Milroy and Gordon 2003, 136): How did the investigators proceed from having hours of tape-recorded speech to reporting the numbers in the tables? I think in what it comes to data archiving and automatization of different work phases we start to be in the point where the connection between the raw data and the resulting analysis should be entirely seamless. In principle the ideal technical framework would allow us to focus only to the scientific side, as that is where the linguistic questions are being formulated and solved. However, although there are many branches of linguistics which do not demand concrete access to the data, it is also very common and sound to base the conclusions into actual occurrences of something somewhere. While dealing with the annotation layers to work with, in practice we almost inevitably have to settle to something that is not perfect, but allows us to get the work done. I’m personally quite strict with this, and having some programming background, I’m very reluctant to get into manual labour which I see computer could perform better, faster and more reliably. However, I think it is very important to identify what are those parts where manual labour is needed and valuable, and built the workflow so that the possible manual strain would be on exactly those sections where human input matters. There are many workflows surrounding sociolinguistic data, for example, one suggested by Nagy and Meierhof (2015). I’m suggesting something very much in that strain, but with the difference that this model is, as I see it, more reliable and easy to maintain. The workflow they describe is still very much centered with exporting files, whereas I would see this as most of the time unnecessary step, since the data we want to deal with is already very well presented in the files we have in the beginning. Parsing this data directly to our analysis has the benefit that the changes in data are immediately present in the further results. In many ways it is often possible to imagine ideal workflow. However, as important as this is, one also has to realize the limitations which may make this unrealistic. A very common issue is that the current tools we have do not allow fast enough annotation if the annotations have to be fit into a very byzantine and complex data structures. Also the problem tends to arise that even though creating annotations now would work, there can be some problems which occur later when the annotations are edited, realigned and corrected. It is possible to delineate following principles: One piece of information should be written only once Data should be interconnected in the way that relations between different units can be reconstructed (this doesn’t need to be simple or straightforward, but these relations have to exist one way or another in machine readable format. More the connections are documented, the better.) Working with annotations should be relatively rapid and effortless In reality one has to balance between these principles. Of course one could argue that the last one is easiest to cut from, but the case is not so straightforward, as it has direct impact to the working hours spent which eventually comes into the number of occurrences in the corpus. This is especially important if more statistical methods are employed, for which it may be reasonable to have several parallel datasets used for testing different hypotheses. If data editing is extremely tedious, then it becomes much less feasible that the data is treated as would be the most suitable. And all this kind of boils down to the fact: There has to be a long-term data curation plan where these study-specific annotations fit Even though some annotations would be done just for one study, there is no reason they should be separated from the rest of the corpus. However, they should be added to the corpus in a way which doesn’t demand extra work from normal data curation. This means that they should not be too fixed to the current values, for example, they should not assume that elements such as tokens are immutable. This would be the case if annotations would be stored externally from the corpus itself, for example, in Praat files or eventually on spreadsheets. For these reasons I have decided to store the annotations as part of the corpus itself. 3.3 Reproducibility By saying that my study is reproduceable I do not claim that my results are necessarily correct. I only mean that the others can verify what I have done and evaluate it with the data I have used. Ideally the study results would be repeated with a different dataset, which would in many ways be actually desired, since that would immediately add credibility to my ideas presented here. As reproducibility is a rather new concept in linguistic sciences, there seems to be quite a bit of confusion over the terms reproduction, replication and independent verification. Biostatistician Roger Peng has written very clearly about this in Simply Statistics blog (Peng 2014). The study follows logic not particularly unusual for a scientific study: a phenomena has been observed and found interesting after further contextualization. A further study was planned in order to find out what it is about, so a corpus sample has been selected and annotated. These annotations are analyzed and the results are interpreted against the ideas that arose after the initial observation and contextualisation. The analysis part is mainly within the 5 Conclusions section of this study. 3.4 Archiving The corpus files are archived in The Language Archive of Nijmegen Max Planck institute. They are organized under the node Permic_Varieties/kpv/. In the archive structure all sessions are treated as entities on same hierarchy level. This may seem confusing, but the idea is that one has to consult metadata in order to know into which project and working group which session is connected. It would had been customary to organize data by academic projects. However, this model becomes problematic when the same data has been collected, transcribed, digitalized, reanalyzed and archived by totally disconnected people often many decades apart from one another. Thereby the only model to arrange these files in an honest manner is to list in metadata all relevant actors and projects involved. In the archive there has been an attempt to maintain rough dialect division, so that the files would be named by prefixes marking different varieties. This is also complicated topic, as same recording contains often data from speakers of different dialects. Individual speakers have often been very mobile, so they also can have mixed features in their everyday speech. As many other good ideas, also this dialect based file naming has been somewhat futile. The subcorpus used in this study today, 2017-04-13, may not be connected to those files the archive contains in whatever future date this study is being read. However, this study refers explicitly to those file versions which were valid and accessible at the time when this document was compiled. 3.5 ELAN annotations The ELAN annotation model used in the corpus is relatively simple, the data being set on different layers which correspond to specific time-aligned utterances. This means that for one Komi utterance there are often different data layers, for example, Russian translation, English translation or comments. Also tokenized data layer is provided, but the tokenized units are not connected to the recording itself. For this study a new layer is added on which the tokens containing sibilants are time aligned and transcribed in IPA. This has been done by copying the token containing tier, filtering out the tokens which do not contain palatal sibilants and time aligning the remaining word forms. The steps taken have been: Copying tier of symbolic subdivision type which contains the tokens into tier of included in type Filtering the sibilant containt forms with regular expression ^((?!зь)(?!зё)(?!зя)(?!зю)(?!зи)(?!зе)(?!сь)(?!сё)(?!ся)(?!сю)(?!си)(?!се)(?!Зь)(?!Зё)(?!Зя)(?!Зю)(?!Зи)(?!Зе)(?!Сь)(?!Сё)(?!Ся)(?!Сю)(?!Си)(?!Се)(?!тс)(?!ст)(?!Ст)(?!щ)(?!Щ).)*$, which selects everything that can’t contain a feature I am interested, and replacing it’s result with an empty string Using ELAN’s Remove annotations or values tool to remove all annotations on this tier when they contain an empty annotation With this workflow we get from this: Elan file in the original state To this, which can relatively easily be time aligned one by one: Added sib-tier with only sibilants left The transcription system used is described in section 2.3. about transcription systems. This means that an utterance: Would eventually be transcribed on the sibilant annotation tier as: mijanɨɕ / миянсьым (optional) / 6 This is not a perfect method, but the best I was able to come up within the rationale and limitations explained above. Now this line contains following pieces of information: IPA transcription on phonetic level, proposed Cyrillic transcription – this may differ from what is on the transcription tier at the moment, but comparison will be done later, tokenized unit we are dealing with on the current reference id. The segment is time-aligned manually and while doing that the position within utterance is counted. There is some space for automation here, but it is still relatively easy to spot later when there have been mistakes, and adding token number manually is an easy to see which annotations have been listened through already. I’m sure one of the first criticues would be why I don’t store these pieces of information on different tiers. The reason is simple: I don’t want to maintain a mess like that. It would also increase the size of the ELAN file very much. I agree that the ideal way to represent data like this would be to store each piece of information separatedly, but my counter-argument is that the data as it is now can be easily transformed into such a tidy format. As always, the way we store the data doesn’t dictate in which form we use or analyze it. It might limit that though, and that is something we should of course try to avoid. This is also the reason why there is so much extra hocus-pocus on this tier. I want to make sure the transformation is painless. All the current annotation model does is to say: This is the IPA transcription of the n:th element on this annotation unit in which we currently are, as was in the Git revision whatever. And by the way, for some tokens one could propose a better way to write them phonemically, but we don’t need to hurry with that. This solves several practical problems: How to make semi-independent annotations which are still somehow connected to the dependent annotations? How to make sure the later changes on the other tiers do not mess up the system Now there is still quite much manual work in translitteration to phonemic IPA, aligning everything and identifying the necessary phonetic adjustments. Thereby I wrote a small function which does the transliteration. The screenshot below illustrates the changes it does inside ELAN file: Sibilant tier before and after running sle2016partanen::sib_tier_cyr2ipa function After this each token on sibilant tier is manually aligned and evaluated. This is relatively time consuming phase, but in many ways it is also the most important one. The whole study is in the end about these variables, so spending most of the time with analysing them is indeed quite appropriate. What I’ve tried to reach in this workflow is state where minimal amount of time is spent in rather unimportant manual tasks, and thereby what really matters gets the time it deserves. In the end automated workflow also makes it possible to reach relatively large sample within the current time frame. Although time is not really the most pressing issue, our daily working hours are in the end always limited. 3.5.1 Caveouts of the current annotation model The problem with the current model is that it is pretty manual and the annotated sibilant containing forms are not strictly connected to the corresponding tokens within the utterances. The main reason to this is that I want the sibilant annotated tokens to remain independent from further changes in the main transcription. It is also somewhat problematic that the actual annotation is usually done in a longer time span and the exact method may be refined. For example, one may realize later a context which should had been taken into account in the regular expression. This leads to a change which is automatically implemented in the further files, but must be manually carried out in older files. This is not a huge problem in itself, but it means that the workflow is easily not as reproduceable and automatic as it may seem. 3.6 Automated processing with R In order to retrieve the sibilant information from ELAN files an R package FRelan is used. It contains several functions for parsing data from ELAN files to a data frame, which is an R internal tabular format which works rather well for data like this. Each token forms its own row. This data frame is merged with metadata which contains biographical and geographical information about, for example, about the speakers themselves and the time and place related information about the context where the utterance was recorded. The variables relevant for my analysis are: Age of the speaker Birthplace of the speaker Place of residence of the speaker Recording time Recording setting (formal, informal) Education of the speaker These variables are compared to the frequency of different sibilant allophones. 3.7 Praat Most of the time the distinction between these allophones is relatively easy to hear. However, I have used Praat in many cases to establish the baseline for these features, and also to validate whether some cases are as complex as they sound like. 3.8 Statistical analysis Statistical methods have not been widely employed within Uralic studies, although sociolinguistics has been practised in different forms. However, for whatever reasons variationistic studies have not been very common. There are naturally exceptions, for example Niina Kunnas’s study of word final vowels in Karelian (Kunnas 2007) falls comfortably to this framework. Within wider perspective of sociolinguistics Sali Tagliamonte gives quite nice overview in her recent book (2016, 107) about the history of statistical methods on this field. She refers to her interview with David Sankoff, with the observation that within sociolinguistics the data generally tends to be messier and more complicated than on many other scientific fields where statistical methods are regularly employed. Later the discussion turns into the fact how ultimately one has to be familiar with the dataset used, and I also However, inevitable conclusion is that one has to employ some statistical tools in order to verify, and also often to find, the patterns in the data. While discussing the use of statistical tools with different researchers one gets often impression that there is not always that clear idea about their use. This is very understandable. As I mentioned, the statistics have not been used that much in Uralistics. However, they are often demanded by reviewers or scientific boards. I’ve heard countless of anecdotes about situations where the statistical tests just have been made because they have to be made. On the other hand, one finds at times something that could be described as blind faith in statistics. Small data, stange ideas – no problems, just make the calculations (or let computer do them). I’m just trying to navigate in these waters myself and to find my own position. As far as I see it, the statistics kind of inevitably come into play when we want to make claims about numeric occurrences of something somewhere. The patterns and frequencies aren’t something we can outline just by looking into data, especially when the amount of data starts to be big enough. Statistics can often tell us whether something really occurs, but they don’t do very much to explain what does it mean or why does it happen. However, the latter questions are also impossible to answer before it is ascertained that the feature is actually there and it has some pattern. The variable I’m investigating fits well into this framework, as there is part of the variation which seems to pattern easily with very traditional statistical tests. One pattern like this is geography. However, in order to contextualize the occurrences better one has to look into the ideologies, stylistic practises and individual agency of the speaker, which sets the study more into the the third wave of sociolinguistic research outlined recently by Eckert (2012).

There are several other linguistic features which seem to co-occur with palatalization. These are at least: Deaffricatization (close to complete) Preference in 3PL verb forms with s-elements (muninɨ ~ munisnɨ ~ muninɨs ~ munisnɨs) Still no clear what individual factors are behind the variation! Question is quite complicated as there are several distinct topics to consider. Among these are the positions of sibilants in the word. If can make a difference whether the sibilant is in the stem or Komi suffix. There is also the question of Russian elements as code switching, or as ad-hoc borrowings, or as old already opaque borrowings. In this treatment I have considered the opaque dialectal borrowings to be part of native Komi lexicon, although the boundaries are not always that simple to draw. What goes on with high frequency Russian items such as numerals? How about very frequent elements like “всё”? Would “друзьях” be in all instances pronounced in entirely Russian manner, compared to possibly more nativized “друзьяяс”? There are also cases like “зависит” and “зависитӧ”, where one has same stem but within Russian morphology as “зав исить-pres.3sg” and in Komi “зависитны-pres.3sg”. Or “занимаются” and “занимайтчемаась”. And what is кальмозере? кӧзяйка? There are also multiple cases where the same speakers pronounce Russian sibilant “щ”. What is going on with that? "],
["conclusions.html", "Section 5 Conclusions 5.1 Stable variation or change in progress 5.2 Variation of variable 5.3 Comparable case studies", " Section 5 Conclusions With many earlier studies it has been taken as granted that Iźva dialect of Komi Zyrian would have palatalized sibilants as a characteristic feature of this dialect, see for example (J. Igušev 1972), or their status is left uncovered but explicitly shows as same as in Standard Komi (Сахарова 1976). My study clearly challenges this view and proposes that in principle Iźva Komi has identical system of sibilants as there is in the Standard Komi, but some subvarieties of Iźva Komi differ from this. It is important to notice, that in the wider ethno-historical context it is necessary to view the palatalal sibilants as the primary and earlier feature of Iźva Komi, and the forms found in different subdialects as a later innovation. The source of palatalized manner of articulation is most likely contact with Russian. However, placing these developments into their complete contexts is a more difficult undertaking. It has been described in earlier studies how the Russian dialects in Ust’-Tsilma area have been in mutual influence with Iźva Komi for several centuries, and this has to be taken into account somehow, especially when palatalization in itself seems to be typical for those Iźva varieties spoken way outside this contact sphere. Since it occurs in both extremes of Iźva territory: Kola Peninsula and Siberia, one must conclude that the most likely point of origin is somewhere in Mala- and Bol’šemel’skaya Tundra. 5.1 Stable variation or change in progress 5.2 Variation of variable 5.3 Comparable case studies This section is just for personal notes. One should collect a good list of similar case studies so that it would be easier to imitate their methodology and style. 5.3.1 Final sibilant deletion in Brazilian Portuguese This is reported i.e. in (Bayley and Lucas 2007, 8). 5.3.2 Salvadoran Spanish -s deletion and aspiration Some Hoffman has been studying this quite a bit.

In some sense the code should be self explanatory as it is well commented, but it is understandable that it is not very clear for those who are not familiar with the programming language used – R. I have tried to explain some very basic concepts so that also non-technical readers can familiarize themselves with this section, but the point of that is to explain what the code does, what is the human logic behind it and what are the tasks it does. The idea is not to make the code itself understandable for everyone, as this probably would not be possible. However, explaining the logic behind it must be possible. 6.1 Code I had initially named this section as Scripts, however, it doesn’t really describe well R based workflows. A script usually refers to a chunk of code which is executed relatively statically. It is ran, and something happens. However, scripts can often be given arguments, for example, one could specify input and output and give some additional parameters for the script. A function doesn’t differ particularly much from this, but it is more flexible unit that can be called from within different code chunks. So instead of taking x and producing y, a function can be a part of workflow where different function are interacting with one another without saving the intermediate files inbetween. Only actual script used here is compile.R file which has to be executed in order to compile this document. In my workflow used in this study the following tasks have been assigned to different R functions. CYR to IPA conversion FRelan R package for daily tasks of loading files Extracting sibilant values Matching lexical items Reading metadata Counting occurrences in the context Visualizations Statistical analysis 6.2 Conversion patterns The automatic conversion from Cyrillic transcription to IPA plays rather important part in this study, so how exactly this conversion is done is important to document. The patterns are stored in ikdp2ipa.csv file, and they can be freely examined or reused. 6.3 Functions 6.3.1 sle2016partanen::transliterate The transliteration pattern has currently some shortcomings, but they are relatively minimal and as every item as to be gone through manually anyway, this is not really an issue. For example, it is not always transparent whether consecutive sibilants such as ссь represent combination ɕɕ or sɕ. Naturally, there is often some kind of assimilation going on there anyway, although trying to identify the pattern in this could be useful task in itself later. What is written above is mainly about the pattern involved, the idea being that transliterate function can take basically any CSV-formatted file from where it read the patters. Why CSV and not something fancier? Because editing CSV is EASY. sle2016partanen::transliterate ## function(data, model){ ## pattern &lt;- read.csv(file = model, sep = &quot;,&quot;) ## cyr &lt;- as.character(pattern[,1]) ## lat &lt;- as.character(pattern[,2]) ## multiple_replace(cyr, lat, data) ## } ## &lt;environment: namespace:sle2016partanen&gt; 6.3.2 sle2016partanen::sib_tier_cyr2ipa transliterate function is now hard-coded into this so that it runs ikdp2ipa conversion to the sib-tier.
